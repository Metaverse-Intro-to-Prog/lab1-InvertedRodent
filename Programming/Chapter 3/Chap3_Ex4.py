#Exercise 4: List for Dinner Invites
#If you could invite anyone, living or deceased, to dinner, who would you invite? Make a list that includes at least three people youâ€™d like to invite to dinner. Then use your list to print a message to each person, inviting them to dinner.


_1=['Ryan Reynolds','Jeff Bezos','Arnold Schwarzenegger']

a=_1[0].title() 
print(f"{_1[0]}, I am inviting you to dinner.")
print(f"{_1[1]}, I am inviting you to dinner.")
print(f"{_1[2]}, I am inviting you to dinner.")
